    <p>Whether you’re celebrating your birthday or a bachelorette party, throwing axes will bring the festivities to a boastfully badass level. We won’t be heaving any hatchets at this Friday’s End of Season Celebration – but we will be raffling off the chance for you and a group of friends to test your mettle with the Backyard Axe Throwing League (B.A.T.L.).

    With a little bit of luck and the right raffle ticket, this could be you:<br>

    If you prefer to get your thrills at the grill, put some raffle tickets towards a gift certificate from West Side Beef Co., a purveyor of local meats run by Ryan Donnovan and Kurt Krumme. The lucky winner will be happy they did when they pick up a box of pastured beef, raised by the Harrison family at Dingo Farms outside of Bradford, Ontario. A typical box contains ground beef, stewing beef, steaks, and braising cuts. You might get some sausages, beef stock, and rendered beef fat in there too.

    If you would rather leave the cooking to the experts, you can invest in a chance to attend The Stop NightMarket next summer. Eat and drink your way to bliss in the heart of downtown Toronto, while enjoying the sights, sounds, and flavours of local performers, designers, and restaurants. This vibrant event will sell out fast!

    For your chance to win these and other rad raffle prizes, don’t miss this week’s End of Season Celebration:
